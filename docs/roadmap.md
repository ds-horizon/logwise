# Roadmap

This page outlines our planned features and improvements for Logwise. We're committed to making log management more accessible, cost-effective, and powerful.

## 🎯 Upcoming Features

- Automate Kubernetes-based deployments with full scaling support across all core components.
- Extend existing AWS implementation to support GCP for complete multi-cloud compatibility.
- Enable custom tagging for logs and metrics to improve traceability and cross-system correlation.
- Establish benchmarking suites to define performance baselines and detect regressions.
- Introduce dedicated frontend and backend services for metadata management and the query engine.
- Implement fine-grained access controls and user roles for secure querying and visualization.
- Define log retention policies and lifecycle management for optimized storage and compliance.
- Optimize indexing and search engine performance through targeted tuning and caching strategies.
- Generate metrics directly from logs and integrate alerting workflows via Prometheus and Alertmanager.
- Build advanced alerting and self-healing mechanisms to improve system resilience and reduce downtime.

## 🔮 Future Considerations

- Natural language query interface
- Multi-region deployment support
- Enhanced compliance features (GDPR, HIPAA)
- Log replay and testing capabilities
