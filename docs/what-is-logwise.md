# What is Logwise?

**Logwise** is a lightweight, open-source solution built to make log management cleaner, faster, and more developer-friendly. It's an end-to-end system designed to handle high-volume log data with enterprise-grade performance and scalability, providing a complete pipeline for ingestion, processing, storage, and viewing.

## The Logging Challenge

Managing logs effectively is a common struggle for development teams:

- Developers spend too much time dealing with unstructured logs
- Existing tools are often complex, heavy, or closed-source
- Small teams and organizations need a simple, transparent, and extensible solution they can afford

## How Logwise Solves This

Logwise (also known as **Log-Central**) is a centralized and scalable system that enables organizations to:

- **Ingest** logs from multiple sources in real-time
- **Transform** and normalize log data efficiently
- **Store** logs in a cost-effective, durable format
- **View** and explore logs through interactive dashboards


## Key Features

### 🚀 High Performance
- High-throughput processing capabilities
- Real-time ingestion and processing
- Optimized data pipeline with minimal latency

### 📊 Log Search & Viewing
- Interactive dashboards with Grafana integration
- Live viewing and exploration capabilities
- Custom filters and metadata-based search

### 🔧 Production Ready
- Self-healing orchestration service
- Production-tested architecture with setup guides
- Reliable and fault-tolerant design

### 🐳 Flexible Deployment
- Docker and Kubernetes support
- Self-hosted deployment options
- Cloud-native architecture compatible with AWS S3


## Use Cases

Logwise is ideal for:

- **Large-scale applications** generating millions of log events per second
- **Microservices architectures** requiring centralized log aggregation
- **Multi-tenant systems** needing isolated log processing per environment
- **Compliance and audit** requirements with configurable retention policies
- **Real-time analytics** and exploration for troubleshooting

## Open Source & Community

Logwise is built with full open-source transparency — including code coverage, CI/CD pipelines, and contribution guidelines. We welcome developers and teams to try it, contribute, and help shape its roadmap.
