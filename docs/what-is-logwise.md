# What is Logwise?

**Logwise** is a lightweight, open-source solution built to make log management cleaner, faster, and more developer-friendly. It's an end-to-end system designed to handle high-volume log data with enterprise-grade performance and scalability, providing a complete pipeline for ingestion, processing, storage, and viewing.

## The Logging Challenge

Managing logs effectively is a common struggle for development teams:

- Logs are scattered across environments, making unified visibility difficult
- Small teams and organizations need a simple, transparent, and extensible solution they can afford
- Developers spend too much time dealing with unstructured logs
- Raw logs lack actionable insights, making it hard to derive metrics and alerts
- Existing tools are often complex, heavy, or closed-source

## How Logwise Solves This

Logwise (also known as **Log-Central**) is a centralized and scalable system that enables organizations to:

- **Ingest** logs from multiple sources in real-time
- **Transform** and normalize log data efficiently
- **Store** logs in a cost-effective, durable format
- **View** and explore logs through interactive dashboards


## Key Features

- S3-based storage with configurable retention policies and no per-GB ingestion charges
- Interactive dashboards with Grafana integration and custom filters
- High-throughput processing with real-time ingestion and minimal latency
- Self-healing orchestration service with production-tested architecture
- Docker support with self-hosted deployment options and AWS S3 compatibility


## Use Cases

Logwise is ideal for:

- **Large-scale applications** generating millions of log events per second
- **Microservices architectures** requiring centralized log aggregation
- **Compliance and audit** requirements with configurable retention policies
- **Real-time analytics** and exploration for troubleshooting

## Open Source & Community

Logwise is built with full open-source transparency — including code coverage, CI/CD pipelines, and contribution guidelines. We welcome developers and teams to try it, contribute, and help shape its roadmap.
